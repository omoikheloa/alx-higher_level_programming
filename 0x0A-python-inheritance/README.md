Python Inheritance
Python provides a powerful mechanism called inheritance that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. Inheritance enables code reuse and promotes the concept of hierarchical classification.

Classes and Objects
In Python, classes are used to create new types of objects. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state, and methods for modifying its state.

Namespaces and Scopes
Before delving into classes and inheritance, it's crucial to understand Python's namespace and scope rules. A namespace is a mapping from names to objects, and scopes determine where names are accessible in a Python program.

The innermost scope contains local names.
Enclosing function scopes contain non-local names.
The module's global namespace holds global names.
The outermost scope contains built-in names.
Inheritance in Python
Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and facilitates hierarchical classification.

python
Copy code
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, species):
        self.species = species

    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow!"
In this example, both the Dog and Cat classes inherit from the Animal class. They override the sound method to provide specific behavior for each subclass.

Conclusion
Python's inheritance mechanism allows for the creation of complex and hierarchical class structures. By leveraging inheritance, developers can build upon existing classes to create new ones with added functionality, promoting code reuse and modularity.
